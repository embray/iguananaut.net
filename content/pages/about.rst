Erik M. Bray
M.S. Applied Physics--Johns Hopkins University
B.S. Computer Science, B.A. Japanese Language and Literature--Universityof Massachusetts, Amherst

I am a software engineer mostly interested in open source science, and
particularly the scientific Python community (though not limited to Python).
Currently my primary work is improving packaging and plumbing of the
`SageMath`_ open source mathematics software system, with funding from the
`OpenDreamKit`_ project.

You may know me from my previous role at the `Space Telescope Science
Institute`_, where I worked on data reduction software for the `Hubble Space
Telescope`_ and the upcoming `James Webb Space Telescope`_, and was a core
contributor to the `Astropy`_ project.  I also occasionally moonlight as a
volunteer instructor for `Software Carpentry`_, where I help researchers and
students from accross disciplines learn software development skills.

Prior to that I did some hacking for shady three-letter agencies.

I live in Orsay, France with my wife `Céline`_ and our three cats.  In my
free time I like bullshitting the cats, learning languages, theoretical
physics, and playing `Ingress`_ (ENL). In the past I've also lived in Japan
and Mexico, and have basic competence in Japanese and Spanish (French I'm
still working on).
