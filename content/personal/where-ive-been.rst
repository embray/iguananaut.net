:summary: What are my various excuses for not updating my blog in over a year

I don't recall exactly what motivated me, but I was looking up something in my
blog the other day and it occurred to me that it has been just over a year
since I last updated it. 

To be quite honestly one of the main reasons, or at least excuses, has been
pure vanity. I'm still not overly fond of the layout and fonts for the site. So
every time I thought of writing something I thought my first effort should be
in making some of those superficial improvements first; but then I convince
myself (rightfully) that I have better things to do with my time than to spend
hours fiddling with CSS and fonts. 

That said, it's a poor excuse. I have since made a few improvements, and though
I'm still not happy with it I don't want to use that excuse any longer. But I
have had other better excuses as well. 

I spent most of my free time in the spring semester of 2014 working on an
independent project for my master's degree that I named
`PyQC <https://bitbucket.org/embray/pyqc>`_ (not to be confused with an ESO
project apparently called pyQC--I'm pretty confident I had the name first
though). This started as a project for my Quantum Information class, but there
were still many possibilities for further development once the class was over,
hence the independent project. I worked on this a bit into the summer as well,
just on my own time. But since then it had languished, which I feel awful
about. Though I did give a (last minute) lightning talk about it at the last
SciPy: http://youtu.be/SMyto7WHiNs?t=18m45s (also check out Tracy Teal's
announcement of `Data Carpentry <http://datacarpentry.org>`_ right before me in
the same video). I think my talk was largely incomprehensible, but it did
garner some interest. I had a number of people coming up to me later asking
things like "Hey, are you the quantum computer guy?" giving me an opportunity
to practice explaining quantum algorithms. 

Another task that occupied much of my summer was helping a friend in political
science get the numbers crunched for his PhD thesis. It started out just
manipulating a couple CSV files, but grew far more involved. I love this
friend, but computing is not their strong suit, and so much time was spent on
hand-holding. I tried to impart some Software Carpentry lessons, but they were
too panicked about just getting the thing done to really listen. Things got
even crazier when we had to handle the Japanese data, much of which needed to
be translated to English before it could be meaningfully compared to the other
data. It was a lot of work (still vastly more for my friend than for me) but I
thought it was an interesting project and we'll worth the effort. I might have
to write something more about it later. 

Meanwhile at my day job a significant amount of my effort was spent on the new
`compound
model <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/modeling/index.html#compound-models>`_
framework for Astropy.

:strong:`Update:` I actually started a draft of this post over a year ago and
never got around to posting a final draft.  For my own recollection though
I'm leaving this post up as-is.
