:summary: One of my favorite songs, "The End of All You'll Know"


This morning I'd like to share a relatively unknown song that is pretty much
one of my favorite songs ever.  I just had it in mind since it played in the
car on the way to work.  It's called "The End of All You'll Know" and is from
the third Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex soundtrack:

This would also be a good time to mention a Korean film we watched a few weeks
ago that is available on Netflix Instant called `Doomsday Book`_ (not related
to the novel of the same title).  It's a sort of anthology of three shorts
about different "Doomsday" scenarios.

The first and the third stories I would classify as "cute" and "funny"--
definitely worth watching though.  First is a uniquely Korean zombie
apocalypse story called "A Brave New World", full of over the top gross-out
humor.  The third is a truly bizarre alien apocalypse story called "Happy
Birthday" which I also feel could only have come from Korea.

The second story, however, I found deeply moving in a legitimate "maeks u
think" way.  Called, "The Heavenly Creature" it is about a robot that is sent
to do menial labor at a Buddhist monastery.  A supposed "technical glitch"
causes the robot to become "self-aware" and believe itself to be enlightened.
The lyrics to "The End of All You'll Know" can't not make me think of this
story.  I don't want to give too much of it away by rambling about it all
morning, but please, please go watch it.


P.S. If you search around a bit you can also find the whole movie on YouTube
but I won't link directly.
