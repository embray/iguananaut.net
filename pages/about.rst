:title: About Me
:slug: about

I am a software engineer and open source hacker currently working at the `Space
Telescope Science Institute`_, home to science operations for the `Hubble Space
Telescope`_ and the upcoming `James Webb Space Telescope`_, where I write and
provide support for astronomy software.  I also occasionally moonlight as a
volunteer instructor for `Software Carpentry`_, where I help researchers and
students from accross disciplines learn software development skills.

I am a jack-of-many-trades master of few.  I have worked on everything from
reverse-engineering to kernel hacking to web frontent development.  I am also
interested in managing open-source projects, software design and management
best-practices, and software packaging and documentation.  I have been a
Pythonista for seven years now and don't see myself going back any time soon—I
do the vast majority of my work in Python nowadays, though I'm open-minded to
any other languages that get throw at me.  I also like C and JavaScript (the
good parts anyways).  I edit in vim.

I have an M.S. in Applied Physics from Johns Hopkins University, a B.S.
Computer Science and a B.A. Japanese Language and Literature from University of
Massachusetts, Amherst.

I live in Baltimore, MD with my partner `Céline`_, our three cats, a bird (was
two, RIP Lady Chatterly), and a snake.
